#### When Should Hash Maps Be Used?
- The hash map is implemented internally in such a way that searching by a key is very fast. The hash map generates a "hash value" from the key, i.e. a piece of code, which is used to store the value of a specific location. When a key is used to retrieve information from a hash map, this particular code identifies the location where the value associated with the key is. In practice, it's not necessary to go through all the key-value pairs in the hash map when searching for a key; the set that's checked is significantly smaller.
> We'll be taking a deeper look into the implementation of a hash map in the Advanced Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms courses.
- Consider the library example that was introduced above. The whole program could just as well have been implemented using a list. In that case, the books would be placed on the list instead of the directory, and the book search would happen by iterating over the list.
> In the example below, the books have been stored in a list and searching for them is done by going through the list.
```java
ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
Book senseAndSensibility = new Book("Sense and Sensibility", 1811, "...");
Book prideAndPrejudice = new Book("Pride and Prejudice", 1813, "....");
books.add(senseAndSensibility);
books.add(prideAndPrejudice);

// searching for a book named Sense and Sensibility
Book match = null;
for (Book book: books) {
    if (book.getName().equals("Sense and Sensibility") {
        match = book;
        break;
    }
}

System.out.println(match);
System.out.println();

// searching for a book named Persuasion
match = null;
for (Book book: books) {
    if (book.getName().equals("Persuasion")) {
        match = book;
        break;
    }
}

System.out.println(match);
```
- For the program above, you could create a separate class method `get` that is provided a list and the name of the book to be fetched as parameters. The method returns a book found by the given name if one exists. Otherwise, the method returns a `null` reference.
```java
public static Book get(ArrayList<Book> books, String name) {

    for (Book book: books) {
        if (book.getName().equals(name)) {
            return book;
        }
    }

    return null;
}
```
> Now the program is a bit more clear.
```java
ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
Book senseAndSensibility = new Book("Sense and Sensibility", 1811, "...");
Book prideAndPrejudice = new Book("Pride and Prejudice", 1813, "....");
books.add(senseAndSensibility);
books.add(prideAndPrejudice);

System.out.println(get(books, "Sense and Sensibility"));

System.out.println();

System.out.println(get(books, "Persuasion"));
```
