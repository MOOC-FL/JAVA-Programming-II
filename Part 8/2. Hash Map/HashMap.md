#### A HashMap
- is, in addition to ArrayList, one of the most widely used of Java's pre-built data structures. The hash map is used whenever data is stored as key-value pairs, where values can be added, retrieved, and deleted using keys.
- In the example below, a HashMap object has been created to search for cities by their postal codes, after which four postal code-city pairs have been added to the HashMap object. At the end, the postal code ``"00710"`` is retrieved from the hash map. Both the postal code and the city are represented as strings.
