#### Object polymorphism
- You are familiar with the concept of inheritance hierarchy.
- You understand that an object can be represented through all of its actual types.
- We've encountered situations where `reference-type` variables have other types besides their own one. For example, all objects are of type `Object`, i.e., any given `object` can be represented as a `Object-type` variable in addition to its own type.
