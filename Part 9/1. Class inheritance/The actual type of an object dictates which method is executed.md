#### The actual type of an object dictates which method is executed
- An object's type decides what the methods provided by the object are.
- For instance, we implemented the class `Student` earlier. If a reference to a `Student` type object is stored in a `Person `type variable,
only the methods defined in the `Person` class (and its superclass and interfaces) are available:
```java

```
