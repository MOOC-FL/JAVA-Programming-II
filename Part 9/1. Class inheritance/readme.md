#### Class inheritance
- Classes are used to clarify the concepts of the problem domain in object-oriented programming. Every class we create adds functionality to the programming language. This functionality is needed to solve the problems that we encounter. An essential idea behind object-oriented programming is that solutions rise from the interactions between objects which are created from classes. An object in object-oriented programming is an independent unit that has a state, which can be modified by using the methods that the object provides. Objects are used in cooperation; each has its own area of responsibility. For instance, our user interface classes have so far made use of Scanner objects.
